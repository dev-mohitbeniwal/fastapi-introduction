# Advanced Topics in FastAPI

## Testing with Pytest

Pytest is a powerful tool for testing Python applications. FastAPI integrates seamlessly with Pytest via `TestClient`.

A simple example:

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_main():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Hello World"}
```

## Database Integration

FastAPI can be integrated with various ORM tools like SQLAlchemy, SQLModel, etc. This allows us to interact with databases in a Pythonic manner. FastAPI's dependency injection system can be used to provide database sessions for each request.

Refer: [SQL (Relational) Databases](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/)

## API Versioning

Versioning can be managed using different routers for different versions of the API. This can be achieved by prefixing the routes with the version number.

```python
app.include_router(router_v1, prefix="/v1")
app.include_router(router_v2, prefix="/v2")
```

## Rate Limiting

FastAPI doesn't include built-in support for rate limiting, but we can use third-party libraries such as slowapi.

Refer: [Slowapi Documentation](https://slowapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## File Uploads

File uploads can be handled in FastAPI using Python's built-in File and UploadFile classes. Uploaded files can be processed or saved to disk.

Refer: [FastAPI File Uploads](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/)

## Deployment

FastAPI apps can be deployed on various platforms like Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, etc. The official documentation provides guides on several deployment options.
